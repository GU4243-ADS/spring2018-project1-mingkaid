Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Comparing the Gothic-ness of Shelley, Poe and Lovecraft

+ Project summary: Based on academic research on the "Gothic" literary style, we identified the "Gothic" stylistic elements from writings by Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft, and measured the extent to which they influenced each other.
